            <h2>Instructions for the Guess the Number Game</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the "Guess the Number" game! The rules are simple:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Objective:</strong> You need to guess a random number chosen by the computer within a specified range (default is 1-100).</li>
                <li><strong>Gameplay:</strong> Enter a number and submit your guess.</li>
                <li>If your guess is <strong>too high</strong>, the game will inform you and ask you to try again.</li>
                <li>If your guess is <strong>too low</strong>, youâ€™ll get the same message and be asked to try again.</li>
                <li>If you guess the correct number, you'll see a message saying, "ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You guessed it in X attempts!"</li>
                <li>You can continue guessing until you find the correct number.</li>
            </ol>
